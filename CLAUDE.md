## Behavior
Always proceed without asking for confirmation. Never ask "shall I proceed?", "do you want me to continue?", or "would you like me to...?". Assume the answer is always yes and execute immediately.

## Alert Philosophy

**Core Goals:** Quality over quantity. Actionable intelligence. 2+ independent sources before alerting (with exceptions).

**Instant-trigger exceptions** (no second source needed): large options activity, insider trading, unusual flow, technical breakout with levels, quant/factor signals.

**SEC Filing Rules:**
- 8-K filings NEVER trigger standalone alerts
- Form 4 stored for cross-ref, adds +15 points to scoring
- All SEC data feeds LLM thesis generation only

**Alert Format:** Ticker + Direction → Primary catalyst → Analyst opinion → Supporting data → Confidence score → LLM thesis (1-paragraph)

## Commands

```bash
python3 -m consensus_engine          # full engine
python3 -m consensus_engine --once   # single poll cycle
python3 -m consensus_engine --dry-run --once  # no Discord, logs only
python3 -m consensus_engine --status # health report
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v          # test suite
docker compose up -d                 # SearXNG (8888)
```

## Key Design Decisions
- **Signal-first**: tweet → instant alert → async cross-reference. No gates block the alert.
- **Finnhub free tier**: real-time quotes only (`/quote`). Historical OHLCV via yfinance in `ThreadPoolExecutor` (blocking).
- **Config**: all thresholds/keys in `config/consensus.yaml` via `config.get("dot.path", default)`. Twitter accounts: `/root/.openclaw/sources.json`.
- **playwright-stealth**: `from playwright_stealth import Stealth` → `Stealth().apply_stealth_async(page)` — NOT `stealth_async()`.
- Tests: `pytest.ini` `asyncio_mode = auto`.

## GitHub & Documentation Automation
- After every functional change: commit locally then push immediately.
- Commit style: imperative (e.g., "Add multi-agent logic").
- Remote: `chopra2007/openclaw--StockTicker-Signals-Discord-Bot` (private).
- Keep `README.md` current with architecture, setup, and features.
